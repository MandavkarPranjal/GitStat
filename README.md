### Project Overview: GitStat

GitStat is a Git repository analysis tool designed to provide developers and teams with deep insights into the evolution of their codebase. It tracks file changes, analyzes commit history, and offers commit statistics, helping users better understand how their repositories evolve over time. GitStat also leverages AI with the Gemini API to offer advanced insights and predictive analytics. 

Built using Golang, the project emphasizes both simplicity and flexibility, offering a hybrid approach with CLI-based reports and the ability to export data for further analysis. GitStat is ideal for developers seeking to measure and visualize contributions, code changes, and project trends in an efficient manner.

### Objective

The primary objective of GitStat is to:
- Provide detailed insights into Git repositories, focusing on file changes and commit statistics over time.
- Offer AI-powered analysis through integration with the Gemini API, giving users the ability to gain deeper, data-driven insights into their projects.
- Enable both in-terminal reporting for immediate insights and data export for further processing or visualization.
- Serve as a powerful tool for development teams to understand the evolution of their projects and improve code management practices.
